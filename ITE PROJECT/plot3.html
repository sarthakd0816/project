        <h2>About Plot 3</h2>
        <p>
            Plot 3 represents the most active and versatile agricultural land of Snehal Farms.
            This plot reflects the farm’s present-day focus on crop diversity, seasonal planning,
            and sustainable farming practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike earlier plots that focused on specific crops, Plot 3 is designed to support
            multiple crops throughout the year based on soil condition, water availability,
            and market demand.
        </p>

        <h2>Crops Grown in Plot 3</h2>
        <p>
            Plot 3 is currently used for cultivating a variety of crops, which helps in
            maintaining soil fertility and reducing crop-related risks.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soyabean</strong> – Improves soil health and supports crop rotation.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugarcane</strong> – Grown using efficient irrigation practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong> – Cultivated with careful water and nutrient management.</li>
            <li><strong>Wheat</strong> – A seasonal crop supporting food grain production.</li>
            <li><strong>Other crops</strong> – Depending on season and land conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This mixed cropping approach ensures better land utilization and stable production
            throughout the year.

        <h2>Farming Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Plot 3 follows a balanced farming approach that combines traditional knowledge
            with modern agricultural techniques. Crop rotation is practiced to preserve
            soil nutrients and prevent pest buildup.
        </p>
        <p>
            Efficient irrigation methods and timely field preparation help improve crop yield
            while minimizing water usage.
