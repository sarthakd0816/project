        <h2>About Plot 2</h2>
        <p>
            Plot 2 is an important phase in the growth of Snehal Farms.
            This land was developed in the late 1990s as the farm expanded
            beyond its original ancestral plot.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of Plot 2 marked a shift toward planned farming
            and crop specialization.

        <h2>Grape Cultivation Era</h2>
        <p>
            After development, Plot 2 was mainly used for grape cultivation.
            This period helped Snehal Farms adopt improved irrigation techniques,
            better crop planning, and market-oriented farming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grapes played a major role in strengthening the farm’s experience
            and technical knowledge.

        <h2>Plot 2 Today</h2>
        <p>
            Today, Plot 2 has evolved to support modern farming practices.
            The land is now home to net houses that provide a controlled
            environment for crop growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with net house farming, sugarcane is also cultivated,
            making Plot 2 a balanced mix of modern infrastructure
            and traditional crops.
