        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Snehal Farms has a strong agricultural foundation rooted in traditional
            farming practices. Farming activities began in the 1960s on a small
            scale, relying heavily on rainfall, manual labor, and local agricultural
            knowledge passed down through generations.
            <br><br>
            In 1985, Snehal Farms was formally established with a dedicated plot of
            land. Early cultivation focused on understanding soil conditions,
            seasonal patterns, and sustainable farming methods, laying a strong
            foundation for long-term growth.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            The vision of Snehal Farms is to combine traditional farming wisdom
            with modern agricultural techniques to achieve sustainable and
            productive farming.
            <br><br>
            The farm aims to conserve natural resources such as water and soil,
            adopt environmentally responsible practices, and continuously improve
            crop quality while ensuring long-term agricultural growth for future
            generations.

        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
            During the 1990s and 2000s, Snehal Farms expanded its land holdings and
            gradually introduced improved tools, better crop planning, and
            irrigation support systems. This phase marked the transition from
            purely traditional farming to a more organized and planned approach.
            <br><br>
            A major milestone in this journey was the cultivation of grapes.
            Snehal Farms successfully produced export-quality grapes by following
            strict quality standards, precise irrigation control, and scientific
            crop management practices.

        <h2>Highlights</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most significant highlights of Snehal Farms has been the
            successful production of <strong>export-quality grapes</strong>. This
            achievement demonstrated the farm’s capability to meet high-quality
            agricultural standards and adapt to market-oriented farming.
            <br><br>
            In recent years, Snehal Farms has diversified into crops such as
            sugarcane, tomato, onion, and green capsicum under net house
            cultivation. Seasonal crops like soybean, coriander, and wheat are
            also grown to support crop rotation and soil health.
